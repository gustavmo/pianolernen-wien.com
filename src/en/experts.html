				<p>
					I was born in Moscow and became interested in music at an early age. 
					At the age of 4, I was admitted to the school for highly gifted children.
					There I learned to play the piano from Edith Ratinova - a pupil of the school's founder.
					
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As a teenager, I was able to take part in several concerts and competitions and 
				at the age of 14 I won the first prize at the first international competition. 
				At the age of 16, I passed the entrance examination to the University of Moscow. 
				and in the same year I performed for the first time as a soloist with a symphonic orchestra. 
				At 21, I passed my final exams with distinction and moved to Vienna in the same year,
				where I took my final exams at the Prayner Conservatory.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In 2019, I graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama with courses in "Chamber Music", 
				"Repertoire and Performance" and "Teaching Skills". So far I have won several prizes at
				international competitions, including first prize at the J. Sibelius 
				International Competition in Finland. My concert performances as a soloist and 
				chamber musician are in Austria and abroad. For 10 years I have also been active as a 
				piano teacher for the past 10 years and regularly attend further training courses.

						<h3 class="name">And a piano teacher does help</h3>
						<p>I always thought I didn't need a piano teacher and that I would teach myself my favourite pieces with YouTube tutorials, but Alina has shown me that professional support makes a lot of sense. I have progressed much faster and with more motivation and fun.
