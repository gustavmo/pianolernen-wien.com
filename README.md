# What
A modern website created with pure HTML, ~~CSS~~SASS and JS - and parcel for some build automation.

# Why
I want to see how a technically minimal website compares to a wordpress or wix website. So far I've been able to get into the top 10 for local search terms like "klavier lernen wien". I guess better content or blog articles would be needed. In the end, I think you can get a small advantage with clean code, but content and backlinks count more.

Feel free to reuse the code, get inspired or give feedback.
